# Friday Night Funkin' Feather Engine
A Friday Night Funkin' Engine designed purely for hardcoded modifications.

## About Feather Engine
There's not much to say. It's Friday Night Funkin' but as barebones and light as possible. And by possible, I mean as possible as my skills will allow.

### Why did you make the engine?
I made it to be used for a mod I'm developing with a friend. Plus, I don't see many engines that are really designed for simple hardcoded mods.
At least, not ones that don't already contain the full base-game (or part of it). Nobody wants that when developing a mod.
I also made it because I wanted to. Is that not a valid reason alone?

### How do I use the engine?
I'm not including any tutorials or guides on how to use the engine. Please learn Haxe & HaxeFlixel if you want to get started.

### Is the engine made from scratch?
Sort of? I reused things like the Conductor, and MusicBeatState from the base-game.
Specifically an older version of it as I'm more familiar with it.

## Build Instructions
I'm not going to actually include any instructions on how to build the game (I'm lazy). This is just here to list libraries you'll need apart from
what already comes with HaxeFlixel.
